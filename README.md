The files in this repository are the the files I created and updated as part of my 3-day coding work experience with Kainos. 

The files in the 'Group Project' directory are the pages of a website that we were told to design and create. 
The brief was to come up with a website for a combination of two randomly assigned technologies, and we were given drones annd natural language processsing. So our idea was for a drone that could be operated using informal voice commands and be bale to interpret whatever the user tells it, almost like a personal AI assistant drone. Hence, we ended up creating a company page for a company that sells such drones, giving the website the availability to order drones and read information about the company.
