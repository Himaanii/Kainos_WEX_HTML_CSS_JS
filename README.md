The files in this repository are the the files I created and updated as part of my 3-day coding work experience with Kainos. 

The files in the 'Group Project' directory are the pages of a website that we were told to design and create. The brief was to come up with a website for a combination of two randomly assigned technologies, and we were given drones annd natural language processsing. So our idea was for a drone that could be operated using informal voice commands and be bale to interpret whatever the user tells it, almost like a personal AI assistant drone. Hence, we ended up creating a company page for a company that sells such drones, giving the website the availability for users to place orders for drones and read information about the company.

The files in the 'My NLP Drone Website Edits' contain modified copies of the files created as part of the group projects, where I went away and experiemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own and improved and added extra features for my own extra learning. Some examples of the features I added, were a greeting on the homepage, that updates according to the time, a button to toggle dark mode and a fresh new style for the website.

The files in the 'My Eatery Website' were the files I created to learn about and experiment with HTML and CSS for the first time whilst we were being taught how to use them by the mentors and using the tutorials they gave us.
